### Make your own file icon!

I created a script file in JavaScript that can be run by Photoshop and make customized folder icons with other icons in a matter of seconds!

You can download it [here](https://github.com/markksantos/Custom-MacOS-Folders/issues).

### How to use script with Photoshop | Tutorial Video

I made a tutorial video on how to use the script with Photoshop.

[![Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/   ID HERE    /0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   ID HERE      )

1. Download the `custom_folder_icon_script.js` file [here](https://github.com/markksantos/Custom-MacOS-Folders/issues).
2. Rename your icons .png files to 'icons_1', 'icons_2'...respectively. 
3. Open Photoshop.


Downloads required to run script:
Script: [download](https://github.com/markksantos/Custom-MacOS-Folders/issues).
.PSD file: [download](https://github.com/markksantos/Custom-MacOS-Folders/issues).

### Similar Projects on Github

The project that inspired me to start this project is a similar project by [Amin Shariati](https://github.com/shariati) called [OS-Folder-Icons](https://github.com/shariati/OS-Folder-Icons) which contains more icons for Mac, Windows, and Linux 💻.

I also used most of his readme.md file as a template to this one, so make sure to have a look at this project too 👍.
