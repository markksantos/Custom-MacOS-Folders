## About the Application

This Java Software allows the user to drag and drop icons into the software and by using JavaScript and Photoshop it automatically make customized folder icons in a matter of seconds!

You can download the .jar executable file for MacOS [here](https://github.com/markksantos/Custom-MacOS-Folders/iFolder.jar).

## How to use

1. Download the `iFolder.jar` file [here](https://github.com/markksantos/Custom-MacOS-Folders/iFolder.jar).
2. Drag and drop the '.png' images into the software.
3. DONE!

#### Requirements to run this application
- Must have Photoshop CC 2019 installed.
- Must be using a computer running MacOS.

#### Recommended icon image types
To have a better result from the folder generator, I recommend that you use '.png' images of icons that are black with a transparent background. Such as this one:

I also used most of his readme.md file as a template to this one, so make sure to have a look at this project too 👍.
